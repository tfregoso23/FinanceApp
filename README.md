# This is me getting familiar with Dart and Flutter by building a self finance app that utilizes multiple widegts that I created
# In this app you can upload all the things you spent money on during the week, and it outputs a bar chart to visualize which days you spent the most
# The app allows you to use the calendar and select past dates and updates the chart accordingly
# The app has design and theming features that adapt to whether the user is on Android or IOS
